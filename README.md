# Predicting Titanic Survivors using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using logistic regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm. The dataset used is the popular Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 🧠 Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used in this project due to its suitability for binary classification problems like predicting survival (Yes/No). It provides probability-based outputs and is easy to interpret.
